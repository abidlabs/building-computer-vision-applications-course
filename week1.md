# Week 1: Image Classifiers (the Leaf Doctor app)

Welcome to the Building Computer Vision Applications course. This course is an introduction to machine learning for computer vision, with a focus on practical applications relevant to industry teams. In this course, we will “reverse-engineer” a number of applications, such as Face ID, plant recognition apps, and autonomous driving so that you know how to build these kinds of applications from scratch.
